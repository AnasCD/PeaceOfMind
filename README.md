Therapist-Patient Platform

Overview

This project is a web application designed to bridge the gap between therapists and patients, creating a secure and user-friendly platform for mental health support. The platform enables therapists to manage their profiles and appointments while allowing patients to seek guidance, book sessions, and access mental health resources.
